## 🚀 GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Container Apps Security Pipeline (`.github/workflows/container-apps-security-pipeline.yml`)

**5-Stage Security-First Deployment:**

#### Stage 1: Security Gate 🚨
- **Mandatory** - Blocks deployment if any security check fails
- Comprehensive scanning with multiple tools
- Zero tolerance for secrets, critical vulnerabilities
- Generates security artifacts for tracking

#### Stage 2: Comprehensive Testing 🧪
- Multi-Node.js version testing (18.x, 20.x)
- Unit and integration test matrix
- Cannabis extraction functionality validation
- Performance and security monitoring

#### Stage 3: Secure Container Build 🐳
- Security-validated Docker image creation
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Secure image metadata and labeling
- Azure Container Registry push with validation

#### Stage 4: Secure Deployment 🚀
- Production environment deployment
- Final security validation before deployment
- Health checks and functionality validation
- Post-deployment security verification

#### Stage 5: Failure Handling 🚨
- Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- Detailed failure reporting
- Recovery procedures and notifications

### 2. Comprehensive Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security-comprehensive.yml`)

**Advanced Security Matrix:**
- Runs 7 different security scan types in parallel
- Daily scheduled security scans (2 AM UTC)
- Consolidated security reporting
- Security policy compliance validation

## 🔧 Local Development Security

### NPM Scripts
```bash
# Security testing
npm run test:security              # Run Jest security tests
npm run test:security:checkov      # Run Checkov secret detection
npm run security:audit            # NPM audit with moderate threshold
npm run deploy:security-gate      # Full security validation gate

# Comprehensive testing
npm run test:all                  # Full test suite with security
npm run test:ci                   # CI-optimized test run
npm run validate:production       # Production environment validation
```

### Jest Configuration
- **Security-first test sequencing** - Security tests run before others
- **Coverage thresholds enforced** - Stricter requirements for security-critical code
- **Multiple test environments** - Separate configs for different test types
- **Comprehensive reporting** - HTML, JUnit, and JSON reports

## 📊 Security Monitoring & Reporting

### Automated Reports Generated
1. **Security Scan Results** - Individual scan type results
2. **Consolidated Security Report** - Combined analysis with risk scoring
3. **Container Security Report** - Image vulnerability and compliance status
4. **Final Deployment Report** - Complete deployment validation summary
5. **Test Coverage Reports** - HTML and LCOV format for analysis

### Security Artifacts Collected
- Secret detection results
- SAST analysis findings
- Dependency vulnerability reports
- Container scan results
- License compliance reports
- Supply chain security analysis

## 🛡️ Security Policies & Thresholds

### Zero Tolerance Items (Deployment Blockers)
- **Secrets in code** - 0 allowed
- **Critical vulnerabilities** - 0 allowed in dependencies and containers
- **Prohibited licenses** - GPL, AGPL, SSPL automatically blocked
- **Security test failures** - Any failed security test blocks deployment

### Warning Thresholds
- **High severity vulnerabilities** - ≤5 allowed with warnings
- **Medium severity vulnerabilities** - ≤20 allowed
- **SAST findings** - ≤5 critical errors allowed
- **Performance degradation** - >20% slower than baseline triggers warning

## 🔐 Container Security Implementation

### Docker Security Features
- **Non-root user execution** - All containers run as appuser
- **Security labels** - Comprehensive metadata for tracking
- **Health checks** - Built-in container health monitoring
- **Resource limits** - CPU and memory constraints
