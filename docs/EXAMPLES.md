### Building Your First Feature
```javascript
// Add a new learning endpoint
app.get('/api/learning/my-progress', (req, res) => {
  const progress = {
    skillsLearned: ['Node.js', 'Express', 'API Design'],
    timeInvested: '2 hours',
    nextMilestone: 'Deploy to production',
    confidenceLevel: 'Growing daily!'
  };

  res.json({
    message: 'Your learning journey is accelerating! =€',
    data: progress,
    learningNote: 'Building features while learning solidifies knowledge.'

const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const learningRateLimit = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: {
    error: 'Too many requests',
    learningNote: 'Rate limiting prevents API abuse and ensures fair resource usage.',
    nextSteps: ['Learn about different rate limiting strategies', 'Implement user-specific limits']
  }
