## üíé **STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE**

**Patent protection is critical for our competitive strategy. Without IP protection, our innovations can be copied by competitors with greater resources, undermining our first-mover advantages and market positioning.**

**The accessibility + AI evaluation intersection represents a unique opportunity to build patent moats in nascent markets before competitors recognize the opportunity.**

**Our patent portfolio directly impacts Series A valuation, acquisition attractiveness, and long-term competitive sustainability.**

**ENGAGE IMMEDIATELY: The patent filing window is time-sensitive. Delay reduces novelty claims and increases competitive risk.**
