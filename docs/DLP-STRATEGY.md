# üõ°Ô∏è DATA LOSS PREVENTION (DLP) STRATEGY
# Home-Grown Crown Jewels Protection Framework

## üéØ **STRATEGIC OVERVIEW**

**Mission**: Protect strategic business information while enabling open-source collaboration and development velocity.

**Approach**: Multi-layered security through file naming conventions, git-ignore patterns, and automated classification systems.

---

## üîê **CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM**

### **Security Levels**
```yaml
crown_jewels: "*.claude-local extension - NEVER committed"
confidential: "strategic-*.md, competitive-*.md - Git ignored"
internal: "internal-*.md - Team access with caution"
restricted: "Limited distribution, NDA required"
public: "Standard .md files - Open source safe"
```

### **Information Categories**
```yaml
crown_jewels_content:
  - "Financial projections and valuation models"
  - "Detailed patent documentation and prior art"
  - "Competitive intelligence and market analysis"
  - "Investment terms and Series A materials"
  - "Customer contract details and pricing"

confidential_content:
  - "Strategic roadmaps and planning documents"
  - "Business development partnerships"
  - "Technical architecture with competitive advantages"
  - "Market positioning strategies"

public_content:
  - "General technical capabilities"
  - "Open source code and documentation"
  - "Basic feature descriptions"
  - "Development methodologies (sanitized)"
```

## üö´ **GITIGNORE PROTECTION PATTERNS**

### **Current Protection Rules**
```gitignore
# Crown Jewels - Maximum Security (NEVER COMMIT)
crown-jewels/
*.crown-jewels
*.claude-local
investor-docs/
patent-docs/
confidential-*.md
strategic-*.md
valuation-*.md

# Strategic Documentation Protection
competitive-analysis-*.md
financial-projection-*.md

market-intelligence-*.md
business-plan-*.md

# Development Continuity (Local Only)
CLAUDE.md
claude-*.md
session-*.md
.claude-backups/
development-notes.md
```

### **Automated Pattern Detection**
```yaml
high_risk_keywords:
  financial: ["revenue", "profit", "valuation", "Series A", "funding"]
  competitive: ["competitor", "market share", "pricing strategy"]
  ip_related: ["patent", "prior art", "invention", "intellectual property"]
  strategic: ["roadmap", "acquisition", "partnership", "M&A"]

file_scanning_rules:
  scan_frequency: "Pre-commit hook"
  alert_threshold: "3+ high-risk keywords in non-ignored file"

4. **Competitive Advantage**: Strategic information remains protected

### **Validation Methods**
- **Monthly security audits** of all document classifications
- **Quarterly access control reviews** with stakeholder feedback
- **Annual penetration testing** of DLP effectiveness
- **Continuous monitoring** of public repository content
