# 🏗️ Cannabis Extractor API - Core Design Principles

## 🎯 Prime Tenets

### 1. **Function Over Form**
> **"Code that works is better than code that looks pretty"**

- **Principle**: Solve the user's actual problem first, optimize aesthetics second
- **Example**: Browser emulation adds complexity but enables cannabis extraction
- **Anti-pattern**: Deleting working features for "simplification"
- **Rule**: Never sacrifice functionality for vanity metrics (lines of code, dependencies)

### 2. **Real-World First**
> **"Build for the internet as it actually exists, not as we wish it were"**

- **Principle**: Cannabis sites have age verification, popups, and bot detection
- **Implementation**: Smart detection - simple sites get axios, complex sites get Firefox
- **Testing**: Always test with actual target sites (Rise Cannabis, not mock data)
- **Rule**: If it doesn't work with the real use case, it doesn't work

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
> **"Start simple, add complexity only where needed"**

- **Architecture**:
  ```javascript
  if (isCannabisUrl) {
    // Use Firefox browser emulation
  } else {
    // Use simple axios
  }
  ```
- **Benefit**: Fast for simple sites, robust for complex sites
- **Rule**: Default to simple, escalate to complex based on need

### 4. **Intelligent Fallback**
> **"Graceful degradation prevents total failure"**

- **Strategy**: Browser emulation fails → fallback to axios
- **Logging**: Always explain why each method was chosen
- **User Experience**: Partial success > complete failure
- **Rule**: Never let one broken component kill the entire request

### 5. **Domain-Specific Solutions**
> **"Cannabis sites are not generic e-commerce sites"**

- **Recognition**: Different industries have different challenges
- **Cannabis-specific**: Age verification, regulatory compliance, bot protection
- **Implementation**: Targeted selectors, specific popup patterns
- **Rule**: Generic solutions work for generic problems, specific problems need specific solutions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Smart Site Detection
```javascript
const isCannabisUrl = url.includes('cannabis') ||
                     url.includes('dispensary') ||
                     url.includes('rise') ||
                     url.includes('leafly');
```

### Response Transparency
```json
{
  "browserEmulation": true,
  "popupsHandled": 2,
  "method": "firefox-automation"
}
```

### Error Handling Hierarchy
1. Try browser emulation (cannabis sites)
2. Fall back to axios (if browser fails)
3. Return partial data (if extraction incomplete)
4. Explain what happened (transparent errors)

## 📏 Design Metrics That Matter

### ✅ Good Metrics:
- **Success rate**: % of requests that return usable data
- **Cannabis site compatibility**: Works with target dispensaries
- **Age verification handling**: Auto-passes verification screens
- **Response time**: Under 30s for complex sites
- **Fallback effectiveness**: Partial success when primary method fails

### ❌ Vanity Metrics:
- ~~Lines of code~~ (irrelevant if it doesn't work)
- ~~Number of dependencies~~ (playwright is necessary for cannabis sites)
- ~~Architectural purity~~ (pragmatism > idealism)
- ~~Bundle size~~ (this is a server API, not a client app)

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. **Premature Optimization**
- **Bad**: Removing browser emulation because "it's complex"
- **Good**: Keeping it because cannabis sites require it
- **Lesson**: Optimize after you have a working solution

### 2. **Technology Dogma**
- **Bad**: "We must use only simple HTTP requests"
- **Good**: "We use whatever works for each site type"
- **Lesson**: Be pragmatic, not purist

### 3. **Feature Deletion for Aesthetics**
- **Bad**: Deleting 625 lines of working browser emulation
- **Good**: Organizing complex code into clear modules
- **Lesson**: Refactor, don't delete

### 4. **Generic Over Specific**
- **Bad**: One-size-fits-all CSS selectors
- **Good**: Cannabis-specific pattern recognition
- **Lesson**: Different domains need different approaches

## 🎯 Decision Framework

### When Adding Complexity:
1. **Does it solve a real user problem?** (Age verification blocking access)
2. **Have we tested with actual target sites?** (Rise Cannabis, not mock data)
3. **Is there a simpler alternative that works?** (Tried axios, got 403s)
4. **Can we contain the complexity?** (Only for cannabis sites)

### When Simplifying:
1. **Does this break core functionality?** (Cannabis extraction is core)
2. **Are we solving a real problem?** (Lines of code is not a real problem)
3. **What do we lose vs gain?** (Lose: working extraction, Gain: shorter files)
4. **Can we simplify without removing features?** (Better organization, not deletion)

## 🏆 Success Principles

### "It Works" Test:
- Can extract actual cannabis products from Rise Cannabis ✅
- Handles age verification automatically ✅
- Returns structured data for price comparison ✅
- Gracefully handles failures ✅

### "It's Maintainable" Test:
- Clear separation between simple and complex paths ✅
- Well-documented popup handling logic ✅
- Transparent error messages ✅
- Easy to add new cannabis site patterns ✅

### "It's Honest" Test:
- Response shows which method was used ✅
- Logs explain decision-making process ✅
- Admits when fallback was necessary ✅
- Documents known limitations ✅

## 💡 Core Philosophy

> **"Build for the real world, not the ideal world. Cannabis sites have age verification and bot protection. Deal with it intelligently, don't pretend it doesn't exist."**

**The v2.0 mistake**: Optimized for lines of code instead of solving the user's problem
**The v2.1 fix**: Intelligent complexity - simple when possible, sophisticated when necessary
**The future approach**: Function first, form second, real-world testing always
