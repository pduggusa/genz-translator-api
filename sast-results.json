However, certain container images may contain `setuid` or `setgid` binaries that could allow an attacker to perform privilege escalation and gain access to sensitive resources. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to add a `securityContext` to the container in the pod, with the parameter `allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `false`. This will prevent the container from running any privileged processes and limit the impact of any potential attacks. By adding a `securityContext` to your Kubernetes pod, you can help to ensure that your containerized applications are more secure and less vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.","fix":"securityContext:\n          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false\n        name","metadata":{"cwe":["CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"],"owasp":["A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration","A06:2017 - Security Misconfiguration"],"references":["https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#privilege-escalation","https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/","https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt","https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#rule-4-add-no-new-privileges-flag"],"category":"security","technology":["kubernetes"],"cwe2021-top25":true,"subcategory":["vuln"],"likelihood":"MEDIUM","impact":"MEDIUM","confidence":"MEDIUM","license":"Semgrep Rules License v1.0.
